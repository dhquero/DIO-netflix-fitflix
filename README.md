### DIO-netflix
 #### Project with Felipe Aguiar mentoring of Digital Innovation One (HTML Web Developer Bootcamp)
 ***
 
 Recreating and styling the netflix page, responsively. 
 Using 
 -  _*html*_
 -  _*css*_
 -  _*Javascript*_

This is FITFLIX! The idea is having a collection of videos directed to physical activity, with recommendations for the user. In addition to implementing javascript to play and close it, even when it's being played. 
I hope I can improve it in the future.
